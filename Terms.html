          Thank you for using Doge Stickers app. By downloading or using the app, these terms will
          automatically apply to you, therefore, you should make sure that you read them carefully before
          using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks

          <b><u>Declaration of Responsibilities</u></b> <br> <br>

          You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain
          functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can
          be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app
          not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your
          data allowance left.

          <br> <br>

          If you are using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
          agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
          your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
          app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you are accepting responsibility for any such
          charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.,
          region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
          which you are using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from
          the bill payer for using the app.

          <br> <br>

          Along the same lines, we cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app, i.e., you
          need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it
          on to avail the Service, we cannot accept responsibility.

          <br> <br>

          With respect to our responsibility for your use of the app, when you are using the app, it's
          important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and always
          correct, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available
          to you. We accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience because of relying
          wholly on this functionality of the app.

          <br> <br> <br>

        </p>

        <p class="privacy-text ">
          <b><u>Changes to the App</u></b> <br> <br>

          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
          requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of
          the app to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
          We do not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with
          the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
          updates to the application when offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
          terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
          otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
          (b) you must stop using the app and delete it from your device.

        <p class="privacy-text ">
          <b><u>Changes to these Terms and Conditions</u></b> <br> <br>

          We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
          periodically for any changes. we will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
          Conditions on this page.
